The Knative Steering Committee (KSC) defines the governance for Knative
in pursuit of the goal of an open, vibrant project with a productive
community, a healthy ecosystem of vendors, and most of all satisfied
customers running their workloads on Knative clusters.

The governance of Knative is an open, living document, and will continue to
evolve as the community and project change. We expect over time we will adapt
the way we run this committee, based on feedback from the community.

## Mission

The Steering Committee's mission is to guide the project such that:

1. Knative is a truly open effort which is inclusive and empowers contributors
1. Knative core is clearly defined with a conformance suite
1. Trademark usage is monitored and violations addressed

## Charter

1. Define, evolve, and promote the values of the project, and address any
   [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) issues that may arise, and
   maintain confidentiality.
1. Review and approve changes to the scope of Knative core.
1. Administer the marks in a transparent way, and take responsibility for
   ensuring follow up on trademark violations.
1. Confirm/reject nominations to the KSC from organizations who are allocated
   seats.
1. Act as the final escalation point and decider for any disputes, issues,
   clarifications, or escalations within the project scope.
1. Delegate all other responsibilities, including matters of governance
   outside the scope of the items laid out above, to competent subcommittees
   who are empowered to drive innovation and evolve the overall project.

## Delegated authority

KSC chooses to delegate as much of its authority as practical to community-run
subcommittees. The committee currently recognizes this delegated authority for:

- Technical guidance is delegated to the
  [Technical Oversight Committee](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md).

## Committee Meetings

KSC meets every two weeks, or as-needed. Meetings are held online.

Given the private nature of most of these discussions (e.g. code of conduct violations, 
escalations, legal concerns, etc.) meetings are held in private.

Meeting notes are available to members of the knative-dev mailing list (link to
be added).

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as [issues in the
community repo](https://github.com/knative/community/issues), and the KSC
invites your feedback there. See [Getting in touch](#getting-in-touch) for other
options.

## Committee members

Seats on the Steering Committee are held by an organization, not by the
individual.

The current membership of the committee is currently (listed alphabetically by
first name):

| &nbsp;                                                     | Member           | Organization | Profile                                      |

|  | Open \*      | Google       |  |


\* Open seats have been allocated to the organization per the committee rules,
  but have not been assigned to a member of the organization.

### Composition

As of 2020, the three organizations with the largest demonstrated 
commitment to the project are Google, IBM/RedHat, and VMWare. For
2021, a 5 person steering committee should be competent to
execute its responsibilities, with three seats for Google, one seat
for IBM/RedHat, and one seat for VMWare.

### Nomination of representatives

Seats on the steering committee are allocated based upon lifetime
contributions to the project by an organization. The intention is
to ensure that those organizations are committed to the ongoing
maintenance burden that adding to core implies, and express their
commitment to the project and the project's users.

- After a seat is allocated to an organization, the organization shall nominate
  a candidate to be confirmed by KSC. The committee reserves the right to not
  confirm a candidate, in which case the organization would need to nominate a new
  candidate
- Members of the committee may step down at any time. When a member steps down,
  their organization shall nominate a new candidate.
- If a member leaves their organization, the organization must nominate a new
  committee member to replace them following the nomination and confirmation
  process.
- If an organization is unable to seat a candidate, the KSC reserves the right
  to reallocate the seat to another organization.
- Changes to the number of seats, which company seats are allocated to, and
  nominations to the committee are confirmed by majority vote of the committee
  members.
- In situations where the organization which holds a seat is no longer a viable
  entity (e.g. merger, dissolution, bankruptcy) the KSC will make a decision on
  how to reallocate that seat. Seats do not automatically transfer to any
  organization.
- Members on the committee have a 1 year term from their confirmation, and may
  be reconfirmed to the committee at the end of their term.

## Decision process

The steering committee desires to always reach consensus. The expectation
is that lack of consensus requires multiple discussions and possibly public
review, and that a vote would be an option of last resort.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present 
and consensus is achieved, or in a meeting where all members are present
and a vote is held and passed by majority.

Quorum is considered reached when a majority of the members are present.

In case of extended absence, the organization of the absent member may appoint a
single delegate from the same company during the absence.

## Changes to the charter

Changes to the KSC charter may be proposed via a Pull Request on the charter
itself. Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of
one week for comments and questions before a vote will occur.

## Raising issues to the steering committee

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering committee at
   [knative-steering@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-steering@googlegroups.com).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on a knative repository and indicate that you would like
   attention from the steering committee.
